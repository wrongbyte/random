### *Or: how your computer’s architecture relates with an assembler (and what is an assembler)*

**“An assembler creates object code by translating combinations of mnemonics and syntax for operations and addresing modes into their numerical equivalents” (wikipedia)**

Assembly is not a high-level language such as Javascript - its syntax has differences that varies depending on the architecture of the computer - or, more precisely, the *abstract model of a computer*, that interacts with the **instruction set architecture.**  The instructions written, then, will be translated to machine code and executed in the way described by the ISA in a device such as the CPU.

In practice, what it means is that Assembly has a close relationship with the architecture of the machine.

## What is machine code? How is it related to assembly?

Machine language is the binary format of instructions that can be stored in memory, decoded and executed by the CPU. 

First, it is interesting to understand how this process occurs. 

What is written in machine code will be read by the *processor*, one *word* at a time (a word is a sequence of bits of a fixed length used by a particular processor design. the majority of the *registers* in a processor are word sized). 

If you had to program directly in machine code, what you would be doing would be just to write a bunch of numbers.  The processor, however, will decode these numbers and take some actions (jump to somewhere else, write a value to memory, etc) based on them. These special hexadecimal values are the **OPCODEs.**

### OPCODE

But reading a lot of numbers and assigning “roles” to them would be exhausting for humans, and that’s where it comes the **Assembly Language**, that does it for us through **mnemonics.**

    `MOV COUNT, 48 ; Put value 48 in the COUNT variable`

To use mnemonics means to replace the OPCODE with a more *human-readable* thing, such as a short instruction as “ADD”.

The example above contains an instruction that puts value 48 in the count variable. The MOV command has the following OPCODE(s), according to wikipedia:

> The OPCODE is part of an **instruction word** that is interpreted by the processor as representing the operation to perform, such as read, write, jump, add. Many instructions will also have OPERANDS that affect how the instruction performs, such as saying from where in memory to read or write, or where to jump to. **So if instructions are 32 bits in size for example, a processor may use 8 bits for the opcode, and 12 bits for each of two operands.**

### Instruction size in x86

The OPCODE we’ve just seen can, by itself, varies up to three bytes. 

from [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4567903/how-to-tell-the-length-of-an-x86-instruction](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4567903/how-to-tell-the-length-of-an-x86-instruction):

```
[prefixes] opcode ModR/M [extra addressing-mode bytes] [immediate]
```

(Instructions with no explicit operands don't have a ModR/M byte, just the opcode byte(s)).

**x86 opcodes are 1 byte for most common instructions, especially 
instructions which have existed since 8086.**  Instructions added later 
(e.g. like `bsf` and `movsx` in 386) often use **2-byte opcodes with a `0f` escape byte.**

> e.g. `0f b6 c0   movzx  eax,al`, so 0F B6 is the opcode for `mov r32, r/m8`, and C0 is the ModR/M byte that encodes eax as the destination (`/r` field = 0), register direct mode for the source (top 2 bits = 11), and `al` as the source register (`/m` field = 0).

## What are the registers

In examples above and in general when reading low-level code, you’ll face the **registers.** They are used as **temporary variables for the CPU**, when it is executing machine code.

You can look at them when compiling a code using gcc and then inspecting a.out with **gdb** (on linux):

The x86-64 architecture has **16 general purpose registers.**

The first eight registers are divided this way:

First four - used as temporary variables for the CPU:

- rax - accumulator
- rbx - base
- rcx - counter
- rdx - data

Second four - pointers and indexes (store addresses that point to locations in memory):

- rsi - stack index
- rdi - destination index
- rbp - base pointer
- rsp - source pointer

After them, there’s some numbered registers and rsi, **that keeps track of what the CPU is reading.**
